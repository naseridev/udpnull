# UDP Load Testing Tool (UdpNull) - Research Implementation

## Abstract

```udpnull``` is a high-performance UDP load testing tool designed for academic research, network performance analysis, and educational purposes. It generates controlled UDP traffic to study network behavior, capacity, and protocol performance in lab environments. Warning: This tool can be used for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if misused. It is strictly intended for controlled, authorized testing in research settings.

## Research Objectives

This tool was developed to support research in the following areas:

- **Network Performance Analysis**: Measuring UDP throughput capabilities and bottlenecks

- **Network Infrastructure Assessment**: Evaluating network equipment performance limits
- **Quality of Service (QoS) Research**: Understanding traffic shaping and prioritization effects

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture

The tool implements a multi-threaded architecture optimized for high-throughput packet generation:

- **Asynchronous Runtime**: Built on Tokio for efficient concurrent operations
- **Multi-Socket Design**: Utilizes multiple UDP sockets per thread for optimal performance

- **High Packet Rate**: Capable of generating millions of packets per second
- **Low Latency**: Minimal overhead packet generation with sub-microsecond timing
- **Burst Mode**: Configurable burst sizes for realistic traffic patterns

#### Traffic Generation Options
- **NULL Packet Mode**: Zero-payload packets for pure protocol overhead testing
- **Custom Packet Sizes**: Configurable payload sizes from 0 to maximum UDP payload
- **Port Randomization**: Random source and destination port assignment
- **Packet Fragmentation**: IP fragmentation simulation for MTU studies

#### Monitoring and Metrics
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live packet rate, throughput, and error monitoring
- **Performance Tracking**: Peak rate detection and average performance calculation
- **Error Analysis**: Comprehensive error counting and categorization
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination with final statistics reporting
